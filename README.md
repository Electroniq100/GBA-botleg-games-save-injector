# GBA-botleg-games-save-injector

This software is able to inject a GBA save file into a botleg/repro ROM game that has been patched for batteryless clones cartridges.

This won't work on a downloaded or dumped ROM from an original cartridge, for now there isn't any batteryless patch available out there.


Only a limited repro game list is available for now :

* Pokemon Emerald GBA
* Pokemon Fire Red GBA
* Pokemon XY GBA
* Pokemon Leaf Green GBA
* Pokemon Ruby GBA
* Pokemon Sapphire GBA 
* Zelda the Minish Cap
* Pokemon Glazed
* Pokemon My Ass
* Pokemon Snakewood



## How Can I export a save from a GBA botleg/repro cartridge ?

You can do so by opening the rom with the emulator called VBA (Visual Boy Advance), once the game is started a .sav file will be created.
Note that it's possible that some botleg Roms won't work correctly on VBA (corrupted save).
